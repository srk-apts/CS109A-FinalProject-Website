title: Automatic Playlist Recommender Overview
---

## Project Statement
Any online buying experience can be enhanced by providing relevant and useful recommendations to the end user. Music streaming platforms are no exception to this. Giving an appropriate recommendation playlist can not only increase the customer engagement but also improve retention and profitability.

Music Recommender Systems come with their own nuances depending on the sequence of items consumed, length of the media items, active vs passive listening, music played while doing certain activities(like exercise, parties, etc), mood or event.

## Project Goals
1. Automatic Playlist Generation - Create a recommender system using the model that most accurately identifies songs for given playlists based on various attributes in the dataset, such as artist names, track category, etc.
2. Cold Start Problem - Create an initial playlist from few playlist items.
3. Develop a business strategy based on the machine learning techniques and findings from above models to best improve customer satisfaction.

Here is some inline math $\alpha = \frac{\beta}{\gamma}$ and, of-course, E rules:

$$ G_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu}  = 8 \pi T_{\mu\nu} . $$
